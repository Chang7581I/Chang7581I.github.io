    <h3 id="style">Giant Alex is a creature with a height of 12 blocks, which has the appearance of the default skin of Alex, with eerie hollow black eyes, gaping mouth, and blood covering the body. It only appears when the render distance is foggy, which can not be higher than 0.2 chunks. Giant Alex is known to stalk and watch the player around but doesn't seem to harm the player despite its size and appearance. However, because of the size of the creature, most people experience fear when it appears out of nowhere. It's unknown why giant Alex stalks and watches the player around the map or what happened to her in that seed, to begin with. Upon wondering the mainland Giant Alex can leave large footprints with a hole of a 4-by-3 pit with a depth of 2 blocks, indicating that it's wandering around. This all began with a mystical seed in version 1.12.2 in Minecraft where Giant Alex lived</h3>
