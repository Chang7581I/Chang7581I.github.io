    <h3 id="faqstyle">How do I restore my health?</h3>
    <small id="sfaq">You can restore your health by consuming various Food items. </small>
    <h3 id=faqstyle>Is "Peaceful" difficulty for babies?</h3>
    <small id="sfaq">Nope. The "Peaceful" difficulty setting is actually pretty nice for both beginners and advanced Minecraft players. The setting disables all agressive Mobs. It also makes your health automatically restore itself over time and your hunger bar stays full. Since most of the joy in Minecraft is building things, "Peaceful" difficulty can actually allow you to focus on the best parts of the game. Also, because mobs are disabled, you won't have to worry about Creepers blowing up your creations.</small>
    <h3 id="faqstyle">What is a "Texture Pack" or "Mod"?</h3>
    <small id="sfaq">Mods and texture packs only apply to the PC and Mac versions of Minecraft. A texture pack allows you to change the appearance of every block in Minecraft, effectively giving a new look to the game. Mods are modifications to the game that allow for new uses or features (e.g. increased mob presence, city generation, nuclear reactors). Mods can be almost anything and are usually pretty interesting to play around with once you've got the basics. Just do a Google search to find some (or check out the minecraftforums website). While neither texture packs or mods are necessary to playing minecraft, they can both improve anyone's playing experience - with a modding API said to be in development, the modding community looks to be more vibrant than ever.</small>
